In computer science class  we have been learning what functions are and how to use them. For example if you put ```(define rr (rectangle 120 100 "solid" "red"))``` in the definitions menu then you can put rr in the interactions menu and a red rectangle with pop up. Other things you can do with functions are things like put-image. An example of put-image is ```(put-image(circle 50 "solid" "blue")250 50(rectangle 300 250 "solid" "red"))``` and what that will give you is a blue circle inside of a red rectangle.
